# Chess Fundamentals

This page contains a compilation of chess fundamentals.

## General Principles

- Method on move finding:
  - is the opponent threatening anything?;
  - are there any tactics in the position (tempo moves first)?;
  - assert imbalances for both sides;
  - find the move that best improves own's position/worsens opponent's position (tempo moves first).
- Tempo moves:
  1. checks;
  2. captures;
  3. attacks of a piece towards a higher value piece.
- On trading pieces: most of the time, to take is a mistake. When a player takes, most of the times he is developing opponent's pieces. Players should embrace tension, and not be afraid of it.
- Placing a piece on a square where it does not work with the rest of its army is rarely a good idea. Chess is a team game and each side wants as many pieces as possible to work towards the same goal.
- Unless the position is very sharp, and positionally speaking, it's usually a bad idea to leave pieces undefended.
- A quote on plans: "The P-word. I think (Jan) Gustafsson doesn't allow people to use the word plan in a chess sense. Actually I completely agree with him! Plans do not exist. There are some ideas, they exist, and then when you've played lots of ideas in the game you can say, "ok, this was my plan", but not beforehand. It's like, what is your plan in life? It's impossible to answer until your life actually happens." - Alexander Grischuk.

## Imbalances

- Imbalances act as a roadmap that shows each player what do to.
- Types of imbalances:
  - Superior minor piece;
  - Pawn structure;
  - Space;
  - Material;
  - Control of a key file;
  - Control of a hole/weak square;
  - Lead in development;
  - Initiative;
  - King safety;
  - Statics vs dynamics.

## Knights

- `N`s do well in closed positions, unlike `B`s.
- `N`s are usually the best blockaders of enemy `P`s, as they are the only piece that can jump, therefore not losing mobility.
- Should be put in outposts, i.e. advanced squares that are no longer controlled by enemy pawns, and ideally controlled by the player. A `N` on the 6th rank (octopus), is usually a pretty strong piece.
- Given an endgame with `N` vs `B`, the `N` should aim for pawns only on one side of the board.
- 2 `N`s don't have the same synergie as 2 `B`s, so such positions should be avoided.

## Bishops

- `B`s do well in open positions, unlike `N`s. The fewer the `P`s in the way of the `B`, the greater its scope.
- Should be in open diagonals. If they don't exist, they should be created or it should be understood where they will exist (one should try at least!).
- A `B` trapped behind its own `P`s is usually called a tall-pawn. Such a `B` is most of the times a horrible piece (a serious imbalance).
- Moving `P`s can seriously affect a `B`s activity (e.g. opening files, pushing a `P` that will blocks a `B`).
- `B`s are usually better than `N`s in the endgame, given their long range capabilities.

## Rooks

- `R`s should be placed in open/half-open files. Both `R`s on the 7th or 8th rank are deadly usually.
- Half-open files should be used to exert tremendous pressure against weak opponent's `P`.
- When there is only an open file, it becomes even more important for the person who owns it.
- Should be placed in the open file that is further away from the opponent's `K`. For example: in case both the `c` and `d` files are open, and the opponent's `K` castled king-side, `c` file should be picked.

## Pawns

- "My main purpose is to gain recognition for myself by means of a new idea of which no one has conceived, or perhaps has been unable to practice; that is, good play of the pawns; they are the soul of chess: it is they alone that determine the attack and the defence, and the winning or losing of the game depends entirely on their good or bad arrangement." - François-André Danican Philidor.
- Whenever a `P` is advanced, weak squares are potentially created, as that `P` no longer controls the squares it used to.
- How to battle an isolated pawn: minor pieces should be traded (as such a `P` can give strong activity to minor pieces), and `R`s and `Q` should be kept in order to exploit that weakness. Keeping the `Q` is important, as she is the best piece to restrain the enemy `K` from getting to the weakness and help defending.
- A backward `P` shares many of the same shortcomings as the isolated pawn, therefore the same ideas apply. It should be kept backwards, by controlling its advancing squares.
- How to create weaknesses: by making the opponent push a `P`, usually by attacking his/her `P`s (either by advancing `P`s or attacking with pieces).
- Doubled `P`s: usually bad, but not always as the doubled `P` can control an important square.
- Tripled `P`s: almost always terrible, as they can be easily attacked and can be blocked by a single pawn.
- Principle of 2 weaknesses: usually a player can hold when only 1 weakness is being attacked. But if another weakness is added to his/her position, then the added defensive burden proves to be too much.

## Statics/Positional vs Dynamics

- Statics/positional advantage last long, while dynamics are like a flare that burns bright for a few moments.
- By default, positional play should be employed. But some positions demand dynamic play, and it's critically important to be able to recognize them. Some simple examples: vs an un-castled king when one has already developed pieces/castled `K`, vs a much better pawn structure, after gambling a `P`.
- The transformation of one kind of imbalance (static or dynamic) into another (dynamic or static) is very common.

\* opposition: situation where both `K`s face each other on the same row, with only 1 square in between them. The player not having to move is said to have the opposition. Given a position where white `K` in on `e3` and black `K` in on `e5`:

- if it's white to move, then black `K` has the opposition;
- if it's black to move, then white `K` has the opposition.

        <h4>~2100 BC - Epic of Gilgamesh, Ancient Mesopotamia</h4>
        <p>Epic of Gilgamesh is an epic poem from ancient Mesopotamia. Dating from the Third Dynasty of Ur, it is often regarded
          as the earliest surviving great work of literature.</p>
        <p>In the original Old Babylonian version of the Epic of Gilgamesh, which was written soon after the invention of writing,
          Siduri gave the following advice "Fill your belly. Day and night make merry. Let days be full of joy. Dance and
          make music day and night [...] These things alone are the concern of men", which may represent the first recorded
          advocacy of a hedonistic philosophy. Hedonism is a school of thought that argues that pleasure is the primary or
          most important intrinsic good. In very simple terms, a hedonist strives to maximize net pleasure; pleasure minus
          pain. </p>

        <h4>~500 BC - Japan's History</h4>
        <p>There was a time when Japan was connected to Asia (land bridge), and so that island was populated. As the world got
          warmer, Japan became an island. By the ~500 BC, Japan was way behind the rest of the world regarding technology;
          stone age against bronze age! They started cultivating rice all over the country, as China was doing. By the year
          593 Buddhism was introduced in the country. During 720 they “stole” the alphabet from China, which improved art
          and literature. Government was more interested in producing art than to make the country safe, so people needed
          to hire samurais in order to defend their properties. Samurais became more powerful than the government (than the
          Emperor), so the real leader of Japan was the Shogun, military leader. After an heir crisis (Shogun’s brother vs
          Shogun’s late son), Japan entered Sengoku Jidai period in 1473. The Õnin War (1467–1477), a conflict rooted in economic distress and brought on by a dispute
          over Shogunal succession, is generally regarded as the onset of this Sengoku period. Fighting in and around Kyoto
          lasted for nearly 11 years, leaving the city almost completely destroyed. The country was completely torn apart,
          as lots of clans fought for the Shogunal succession. During this period, Portuguese arrived to Japan just in time
          to sell guns, and religion as well, but without success. After a few wars and betrayal, daimyo Toyotomi Hideyoshi
          (feudal lord, subordinate only to the Shogun) managed to conquer Japan by 1590. Daimyo ensured his position by
          calling a sword hunt (no one except the Samurai were allowed to have a sword/gun). Sakoku (1633 - 1866) was the
          foreign relations policy of Japan under which severe restrictions were placed on the entry of foreign nationals
          to Japan and Japanese nationals were forbidden to leave the country on penalty of death if they returned without
          special permission. On March 31, 1854, the Kanagawa Treaty was the first treaty between the USA and the Tokugawa
          Shogunate. Signed under threat of force, it effectively meant the end of Japan’s 220-year-old policy of national
          seclusion and the opening of ports to American vessels. The treaty also precipitated the signing of similar treaties
          establishing diplomatic relations with other western powers (Britain, Russia). In 1868 the Tokugawa Shogun, who
          ruled Japan in the feudal period, lost his power and the emperor was restored to the supreme position. The emperor
          took the name Meiji ("enlightened rule") as his reign name; this event was known as the Meiji Restoration (1868
          - 1912). This was an era of modernization: by very deliberate study, borrowing, and adaptation of Western political
          (imperialism), military, technological (steam engine, roads, trains), economic (silk, coal), and social forms —
          repeating a pattern seen previously in the classical period when Japan studied Chinese civilization (particularly
          in the 7th century to 8th century). Japan's successful transformation into a modern, military power is demonstrated
          first in 1894-95 as they win the Sino-Japanese War against China over control of Korea. Japan then defeats Russia,
          a major Western power, in the Russo-Japanese War of 1905-06 over rights in Manchuria and Korea. Russia sought a
          warm-water port on the Pacific Ocean for their navy and for maritime trade. By 1910, Japan annexes Korea as a colony
          and takes control over indigenous Korean modernization efforts. During WW1 Japan had an important role securing
          the sea lanes in the West Pacific against the Imperial German Navy. After the war Tokyo gained a permanent seat
          on the Council of the League of Nations and kept some isles in the Pacific. In 1931, Japan takes control of Manchuria.
          From 1937 to 1945, Japan invades the rest of China, Second Sino-Japanese War.

        <h4>490 BC to 420 BC - Protagoras, Ancient Greece</h4>
        <p>"Man is the measure of all things: of the things that are, that (how) they are, of the things that are not, that
          (how) they are not." - Protagoras on Relativism.</p>
        <p>
          Relativism is the concept that points of view have no absolute truth or validity, having only relative, subjective value
          according to differences in perception and consideration. As moral relativism, the term is often used in the context
          of moral principles, where principles and ethics are regarded as applicable in only limited context. Nietzsche
          goes further to say that the perception of the world over time does not evolve in a rational way but according
          to the "Will to Power", contrary to Hegel that claims that it evolves according to reason. Everything is only valid
          for a limited period of time.

        <h4>469/470 BC to 399 BC - Socrates, Ancient Greece</h4>
        <p>Perhaps Socrates' most important contribution to Western thought is his dialectic method of inquiry, known as the
          Socratic method, which he largely applied to the examination of key moral concepts such
          as the Good and Justice. To solve a problem, it would be broken down into a series of questions, the answers to
          which gradually distill the answer a person would seek.

        <h4>~428 BC to ~348 BC - Plato, Ancient Greece</h4>
        <p>Pluralism, as a political philosophy is the recognition and affirmation of diversity within a political body, which
          permits the peaceful coexistence of different interests, convictions and lifestyles. Political pluralists are not
          inherently socialists (who put equality as their guiding principle), liberals (who place liberty as their guiding
          principle) or conservatives (who place tradition as their guiding principle) but advocate a form of political moderation.
          Nor are political pluralists necessarily advocates of a democratic plurality, but generally agree that this form
          of government is often best at moderating discrete values.</p>
        <p>
          Realism is the belief that some aspect of our reality is ontologically independent of our conceptual schemes, perceptions,
          linguistic practices, beliefs, etc. Realism can also be promoted in an unqualified sense, in which case it asserts
          the mind-independent existence of a visible world, as opposed to skepticism and solipsism. Realists tend to believe
          that whatever we believe now is only an approximation of reality and that every new observation brings us closer
          to understanding reality. In its Kantian sense, realism is contrasted with idealism. "I know that I know nothing"

        <p>Skepticism is generally any questioning attitude towards knowledge, facts, or opinions/beliefs stated as facts, or
          doubt regarding claims that are taken for granted elsewhere. A philosophical skeptic does not claim that truth
          is impossible, which itself would be a truth claim, instead it recommends "suspending belief".

        <h4>341 BC to 270 BC - Epicurus, Ancient Greece</h4>
        <p>Epicureanism is a system of philosophy based upon the teachings of the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus, founded
          around 307 BC. Epicurus was an atomic materialist, following in the steps of Democritus. His materialism led him
          to a general attack on superstition and divine intervention. Following Aristippus, about whom very little is known,
          Epicurus believed that what he called "pleasure" is the greatest good, but the way to attain such pleasure is to
          live modestly and to gain knowledge of the workings of the world and the limits of one's desires. This led one
          to attain a state of tranquility (ataraxia) and freedom from fear, as well as absence of bodily pain (aponia).
          The combination of these two states is supposed to constitute happiness in its highest form. Although Epicureanism
          is a form of hedonism (decadence), insofar as it declares pleasure to be the sole intrinsic good, its conception
          of absence of pain as the greatest pleasure and its advocacy of a simple life makes it different from "hedonism"
          as it is commonly understood.
        </p>
        <p>
          Materialism is a form of philosophical monism which holds that matter is the fundamental substance in nature, and that all
          phenomena, including mental phenomena and consciousness, are the result of material interactions.

        <h4>334 BC to 262 BC - Zeno of Citium, Ancient Greece</h4>
        <p>Stoicism: the only thing that is truly good is an excellent mental state, identified with virtue and reason. This
          is the only thing that can guarantee our happiness. External things such as money, success, fame and the like can
          never bring us happiness. Although there is nothing wrong with these things and they do hold value and may well
          form part of a good life, often the pursuit of these things actually damages the only thing that can bring us happiness:
          an excellent, rational mental state. Our emotions are the project of our judgements, of thinking that something
          good or bad is happening or is about to happen. Many of our negative emotions are based on mistaken judgements,
          but because they are due to our judgements it means they are within our control.

        <p>Feudalism was a combination of legal and military customs in medieval Europe that flourished between the 9th and
          15th centuries. Broadly defined, it was a way of structuring society around relationships derived from the holding
          of land in exchange for service or labour. Hierarchy: King > Noble > Knight > Peasant. Kings divided their lands,
          so they were better manageable.

        <h4>1346 to 1353 - Black Death, Europe</h4>
        <p>In the early 1330s a deadly bubonic plague occurred in China. The bubonic plague mainly affects rodents, but fleas
          can transmit the disease to people. Once people are infected, they infect others very rapidly. Because “witches”
          were hunted down by this time in Europe (Medieval Age, right?), domestic and feral cats were also killed because
          they were thought to be witches familiars, that without one, a witch could not cast spells. So once cats started
          disappearing into the fires, the entire European world was ripe for an epidemic of rats. Rats showed up in 1346
          in the Crimea, via the Silk Road from China. There were no cats to check the rats stowing away onboard merchant
          ships, and these rats were infested with infected fleas. The plague reduced the world population from an estimated
          450M million down to 350M ~ 375M.

          philosophy (or, perhaps more accurately, a method of learning) taught by the academics of medieval universities
          and cathedrals in the period from the 12th to 16th Century. It combined Logic, Metaphysics and semantics into one
          discipline, and is generally recognised to have developed our understanding of Logic significantly.

        <h4>~1400 - Capitalism, Europe</h4>
        <p>Capitalism has existed incipiently on a small scale for centuries, in the form of merchant, renting and lending activities,
          and occasionally as small-scale industry with some wage labour. Capitalism in its modern form can be traced to
          the emergence of agrarian capitalism and mercantilism in the Renaissance. Capitalists believe that the government
          does not use economic resources as efficiently as private enterprises do, and therefore society is better off with
          the free market determining economic winners and losers. An economic system characterized by private or corporate
          ownership of capital goods, by investments that are determined by private decision, and by prices, production,
          and the distribution of goods that are determined mainly by competition in a free market.
        </p>
        <p>
          Capitalism (economic system) plus Democracy (political system) supposed to be a match made in heaven. Today Capitalism, long
          sold as the yin to democracy’s yang, is thriving, while democracy is struggling to keep up. Why has capitalism succeeded while democracy has steadily weakened? Democracy has become enfeebled largely because
          companies, in intensifying competition for global consumers and investors, have invested ever greater sums in lobbying,
          public relations, and even bribes and kickbacks, seeking laws that give them a competitive advantage over their
          rivals. The result is an arms race for political influence that is drowning out the voices of average citizens.

          are all too equal, so there would be a lot of chaos (no human is that much better than another, right?). Giving

          to give to the government and which to keep to themselves. On the other hand Jean-Jacques Rousseau preferred a
          top-down model; there are no right until a government is formed, and then that government decides which rights
          to give to the population.

          Neoclassicism was the trend prevailing during the late 18th and early 19th centuries, characterized by the introduction and
          widespread use of Greek orders and decorative motifs, the subordination of detail to simple, strongly geometric
          overall compositions, the presence of light colors or shades frequent shallowness of relief in ornamental treatment
          of facades, and the absence of textural effects.

        <p>
          Romanticism emerged as a reaction against Neoclassicism. The Neoclassical age emphasized on reason and logic. The Romantic
          period wanted to break away from the traditions and conventions that were dear to the Neoclassical age and make
          way for individuality and experimentation. Characteristics of Romanticism are belief in feelings, imagination,
          intuition, primitive, natural modes, rural solitude, spiritual, idea, infinite, myth-making, beauty, truth, subjectivity,
          intensity, curiosity.

        <p>Theory of Natural Human: Rousseau believed that the ideal society was based on his idea of the natural man. According
          to this idea, humans were corrupted by society and had come a long ways from being what they were intended to be.
          Rousseau thought that natural man was humanity that acted out of feelings and from the heart. Over time, Rousseau
          believed that humans had lost their capacity to respond in accordance to what nature intended. The reclaimed nature,
          together with his vision of the ideal society would allow humans to once again live up to their moral potential.
          In Rousseau's reclaimed society, equality, not freedom, was to be the goal. Likewise, common well-being rather
          than individual preference would be the preeminent.</p>

          Phenomenalism is the view that physical objects cannot justifiably be said to exist in themselves, but only as perceptual
          phenomena or sensory stimuli (e.g. redness, hardness, softness, sweetness, etc.) situated in time and in space.
          In particular, some forms of phenomenalism reduce talk about physical objects in the external world to talk about
          bundles of sense-data.

        <p>On Irrationality, Hegel says that human theories about the world are relative to time and space (relativism), that
          perception of the world of the Greeks are different from the Roman's for example. But Hegel also claims that it's
          possible to describe them in an absolute way (theories of theories), he claims that it's possible to tell how these
          theories progress through history. Nietzsche on the other hand claims that this is not true, that it's not possible
          to create these theories about the perception of the world. Nietzsche says that we are irrational (will to power!).
          We don't move from one theory to another on a basis of knowledge/rationality, but on a basis of power. Back to
          Hegel, he claims that the evolution of these theories was rational: formulate hypothesis, test it, reformulate,
          etc. Nietzsche again says that it's irrational, reason is not used. "Everything, however, became what it is. There
          are no eternal facts. There are no absolute truths. Therefore, what is needed from now on is historical philosophizing
          and with it the virtue of modesty." - Nietzsche.</p>

          The history of socialism has its origins in the French Revolution of 1789 and the changes brought about by the French Revolution,
          although it has precedents in earlier movements and ideas. Socialists believe economic inequality is bad for society,
          and the government is responsible for reducing it via programs that benefit the poor. An extreme form of socialism
          is communism and fascism. Communism controls economy by direct means (government itself), while fascism controls
          economy by indirect means (regulation, etc).

        <h4>1788 to 1860 - Arthur Schopenhauer, Germany</h4>
        <p>The World as Will. The will that Schopenhauer mentioned is the Will to Live. Schopenhauer used Kant's Idealism to
          arrive to the World as Will. Every person has his body (and only his body!) presented to him via sensation/perception,
          and his will presented via inner experience. Egoism is the natural condition of all humans. The few people that
          can get rid of this egoism for a few moments attain real beauty. Will to live makes every human strive to live
          for as long as they can, to in the end die as everyone else.
        </p>
        <p>
          Voluntarism is "any metaphysical or psychological system that assigns to the will a more predominant role than that attributed

        <p>"Women remain children all their lives, for they always see only what is near at hand, cling to the present, take
          the appearance of a thing for reality, and prefer trifling matters to the most "important"."</p>
        <p>"It is because women’s reasoning powers are weaker that they show more sympathy for the unfortunate than men, and

          the general notions of freethought on which it was based had existed throughout history. Holyoake invented the
          term "secularism" to describe his views of promoting a social order separate from religion, without actively dismissing
          or criticizing religious belief. An agnostic himself, Holyoake argued that "Secularism is not an argument against
          Christianity, it is one independent of it. It does not question the pretensions of Christianity; it advances others.
          Secularism does not say there is no light or guidance elsewhere, but maintains that there is light and guidance
          in secular truth, whose conditions and sanctions exist independently, and act forever. Secular knowledge is manifestly
          that kind of knowledge which is founded in this life, which relates to the conduct of this life, conduces to the
          welfare of this life, and is capable of being tested by the experience of this life."

        <h4>1818 to 1883 - Karl Marx, Germany</h4>
        <p>Throughout all of human history there is something that happens, no matter what kind of society, no matter when in
          human history, that we as humans fail to appreciate, consider and integrate into how we understand the world we
          live in: some people use their brains and their body to transform nature in a useful way, i.e. they do work, and
          some people do not. The easiest and most simple example is babies and elderly people. This raises a question: how
          is it possible for people who do not work to survive? For each person that works, the produce of their work that
          goes to maintaining themselves, Marx calls Necessary Labor, and the produce of their work that they do not consume
          themselves, Marx calls Surplus Labor. Capitalism is a relationship where someone (a capitalist), pays someone else
          (a worker), to do work for them, and in this relationship the worker contributes MORE than they receive in the
          form of a wage or salary. The work is done by wage or salary earners, and they do not control, maintain, or distribute
          the surplus that they produce. They receive a wage or salary, and all of what they produce belongs to the capitalist/owner.
          It is precisely in paying workers less than they contribute that the capitalist/owner is able to make a profit.
          Could we collectively run businesses and make decisions as groups (surplus' distribution), i.e. communally (communist)?
          The common objection to this Marxist perspective is: “But the capitalist/owner is risking his or her own money
          in the business, so they have to receive a profit, or why else would they invest their money in starting a business.”.
        </p>
        <p>Marx was a journalism. In 1848, Communist Manifesto is published. "Life is not determined by consciousness, but consciousness
          by life." - Karl Marx. By consciousness he means thought/ideas, by life he means material/economic forces. So this
          means that it's the materialism that leads to your ideas (nuts?). "Religion is the opiate of the masses". Class
          struggle: Bourgeoisie (who owns production) vs Proletarian (workers). He considers other classes, but these two
          are the most important, and with the highest impact on society. How to avoid class struggle? Abolition private
          property! No private property => no owners => no bourgeoisie => no struggle. Marxist Program: progressive income
          tax (the more you earn, the more you pay), no inheritance, nationalize banks, state ownership of anything that
          produces value, industrial armies, free education. Why work at all? Where is the motivation? Marx claims that this
          is a temporary problem (xD). Eventually, human nature will change. "The philosophers have only interpreted the
          world, the point is to change it.". </p>

        <p>Dostoyevsky was a conservative, he believed in freedom. Christianity is essential to ordered liberty. Without it,
          there is no foundation for a belief of human dignity and equality. Most people are like children, they just want
          to be fed (Karamazov Brothers). They don't want the responsibility/freedom of choosing between believing or not
          in God. These are the sheeps, that just want to be fed. The other are the shepherds, those who can define what's
          good and what's evil. They have no religion (nor anything else) to guide them, only themselves. Shepherds, according
          to Dostoyevsky, are not capable of leading the sheeps because they don't know where to guide them (nihilists?).
          They have cut themselves from everything that would be able to tell good from evil. The very people that wants
          to lead are the least equipped to it. If you are a shepherd, you cannot respect mankind because you believe them
          to be sheep. It's either you (narcissism) or God that can define for a man good from evil.

        <p>Man, the bravest of animals and the one most accustomed to suffering, does not repudiate suffering as such; he desires

        <p>Nihilism:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Nietzsche characterized nihilism as emptying the world and especially human existence of meaning, purpose, comprehensible
            truth, or essential value;</li>
          <li>Christian moral doctrine provides people with intrinsic value, belief in God (which justifies the evil in the world)
            and a basis for objective knowledge;</li>
          <li>In its drive towards truth, Christianity eventually finds itself to be a construct, which leads to its own dissolution;</li>
          <li>It is therefore that Nietzsche states that we have outgrown Christianity "not because we lived too far from it,
            rather because we lived too close";</li>
          <li>The self-dissolution of Christianity constitutes yet another form of nihilism, because Christianity was an interpretation
            that posited itself as the interpretation; </li>
          <li>Nietzsche characterises passive nihilism (ascetic attitude) as a "will to nothingness", whereby life turns away
            from itself, as there is nothing of value to be found in the world;</li>
          <li>"I praise, I do not reproach, (nihilism) arrival. I believe it is one of the greatest crises, a moment of the deepest
            self-reflection of humanity. Whether man recovers from it, whether he becomes master of this crisis, is a question
            of his strength!";</li>
          <li>There is at least the possibility of another type of nihilist in the wake of Christianity's self-dissolution, one
            that does not stop after the destruction of all value and meaning and succumb to the following nothingness. This
            alternate, "active" nihilism on the other hand destroys to level the field for constructing something new.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This wilful destruction of values and the overcoming of the condition of nihilism by the constructing of new meaning,
          active nihilism, could be related to what Nietzsche elsewhere calls a 'free spirit' or the Übermensch from "Thus
          Spoke Zarathustra" and "The Antichrist", the model of the strong individual who posits his own values and lives
          his life as if it were his own work of art. Slave Morality comes about as a reaction to master-morality. Here,
          value emerges from the contrast between good and evil: good being associated with other-worldliness, charity, piety,
          restraint, meekness, and submission; and evil seen as worldly, cruel, selfish, wealthy, and aggressive. Nietzsche
          sees slave morality as pessimistic and fearful, values for them serving only to ease the existence for those who
          suffer from the very same thing. He associates slave-morality with the Jewish and Christian traditions, in a way
          that slave-morality is born out of the ressentiment of slaves. Nietzsche argued that the idea of equality allowed
          slaves to overcome their own condition without hating themselves. And by denying the inherent inequality of people
          (such as success, strength, beauty or intelligence), slaves acquired a method of escape, namely by generating new
          values on the basis of rejecting something that was seen as a perceived source of frustration. It was used to overcome
          the slave's own sense of inferiority before the (better-off) masters. It does so by making out slave weakness to
          be a matter of choice, by, e.g., relabeling it as "meekness." The "good man" of master morality is precisely the
          "evil man" of slave morality, while the "bad man" is recast as the "good man.". Nietzsche sees the slave-morality
          as a source of the nihilism that has overtaken Europe. Modern Europe and Christianity exist in a hypocritical state
          due to a tension between master and slave morality, both values contradictorily determining, to varying degrees,
          the values of most Europeans (who are motley). Nietzsche calls for exceptional people to no longer be ashamed of
          their uniqueness in the face of a supposed morality-for-all, which he deems to be harmful to the flourishing of
          exceptional people. He cautions, however, that morality, per se, is not bad; it is good for the masses, and should
          be left to them. Exceptional people, on the other hand, should follow their own "inner law." and thus became the
          Übermensch (Overman). A favorite motto of Nietzsche reads: "Become what you are.".

        <p>Apollonian and Dionysian: is a philosophical and literary concept, or dichotomy, based on certain features of ancient
          Greek mythology. Many Western philosophical and literary figures have invoked this dichotomy in critical and creative
          works. In Greek mythology, Apollo and Dionysus are both sons of Zeus. Apollo is the god of reason and the rational,
          while Dionysus is the god of the irrational and chaos. The Greeks did not consider the two gods to be opposites
          or rivals, although often the two deities were interlacing by nature. The Apollonian is based on reason and logical
          thinking. By contrast, the Dionysian is based on chaos and appeals to the emotions and instincts. The content of
          all great tragedy is based on the tension created by the interplay between these two.</p>

          deregulation and an absence of legitimate aspirations.

        <h4>1883 to 1924 - Franz Kafka, Austria-Hungary</h4>
        <p>Kafka's writing has inspired the term "Kafkaesque", used to describe concepts and situations reminiscent of his work,
          particularly "Der Process" (The Trial) and "Die Verwandlung" (The Metamorphosis). Examples include instances in
          which bureaucracies overpower people, often in a surreal, nightmarish milieu which evokes feelings of senselessness,
          disorientation, and helplessness. Characters in a Kafkaesque setting often lack a clear course of action to escape
          a labyrinthine situation. Kafkaesque elements often appear in existential works, but the term has transcended the
          literary realm to apply to real-life occurrences and situations that are incomprehensibly complex, bizarre, or
          illogical.

        <h4>1892 to 1973 - John Ronald Reuel Tolkien, England</h4>
        <p>J. R. R. Tolkien was an English writer, poet, philologist, and university professor who is best known as the author
          of the classic high-fantasy works The Hobbit (1937), The Lord of the Rings (1954), and The Silmarillion (1977).
        </p>
        <p>Tolkien's extensive use of duality and parallelism, contrast and opposition is found throughout the novel, in hope
          and despair, knowledge and enlightenment, death and immortality, fate and free will. One famous example is the
          often criticized polarity between Good and Evil in Tolkien. Orcs, the most maligned of races, are a corruption
          of the mystically exalted race of the Elves. Minas Morgul, the Tower of Sorcery, home of the Lord of the Nazgûl,
          the most corrupted King of Men, directly opposes Minas Tirith, the Tower of Guard and the capital of Gondor, the
          last visible remnant of the ancient kingdom of Men in the Third Age. These antitheses, though pronounced and prolific,
          are sometimes seen to be too polarizing, but they have also been argued to be at the heart of the structure of
          the entire story. Tolkien's technique has been seen to "confer literality on what would in the primary world be
          called metaphor and then to illustrate (in his secondary world) the process by which the literal becomes metaphoric."</p>
        <p>Death and Immortality; Tolkien wrote about The Lord of the Rings and death in his Letters: "But I should say, if
          asked, the tale is not really about Power and Dominion: that only sets the wheels going; it is about Death and
          the desire for deathlessness. Which is hardly more than to say it is a tale written by a Man!" (Letter 203, 1957)
          "It is mainly concerned with Death, and Immortality; and the 'escapes': serial longevity, and hoarding memory."
          (Letter 211, 1958). The corruption of power; Gandalf rejects the Ring after Frodo offers it to him, and this view
          of the nature of the Ring is reinforced as Elrond, Galadriel, Aragorn and Faramir in their turn, also reject the
          Ring, supposedly fearing the fact that it will ultimately create wicked desires within them. Inversely, the hobbits'
          complacency and lack of ambition appears to make them less susceptible to the Ring's promises of power, as is seen
          in Frodo and Sam, both of whom are able to handle the Ring for extended periods of time. It is of note that hobbits
          are not totally immune to the Ring's effects, however, as is seen most clearly in Frodo, Bilbo and, arguably, Gollum.
          This is a very modern, 20th-century theme, since in earlier, medieval times, power was considered to "reveal character",
          not alter it.
        </p>
        <p>Technophobia; Tolkien's criticism of technology has been observed by several authors. Anne Pienciak notes that technology
          is only employed by the forces of evil in Tolkien's works, and that he found it to be one of "the evils of the
          modern world: ugliness, depersonalization, and the separation of man from nature." Examples of this technophobia
          have been identified, for instance, in many aspects of the Saruman character. The chapter "The Scouring of the
          Shire" sees the industrial technology imported by Saruman's minions as an evil threat to replace the traditional
          crafts of the Shire hobbits, and was removed after his death. It is also of note that the Ents - "Shepherds of
          the Trees" - are instrumental in Saruman's downfall.

        <h4>1913 to 1959 - Albert Camus, French Algeria</h4>
        <p>Existentialism is a term applied to the work of certain late 19th- and 20th-century European philosophers (Albert
          Camus, Jean Paul Sartre) who, despite profound doctrinal differences, shared the belief that philosophical thinking
          begins with the human subject, not merely the thinking subject, but the acting, feeling, living human individual.
          While the supreme value of existentialist thought is commonly acknowledged to be freedom, its primary virtue is
          authenticity. In the view of the existentialist, the individual's starting point is characterized by what has been
          called "the existential attitude", or a sense of disorientation and confusion in the face of an apparently meaningless
          or absurd world. Many existentialists have also regarded traditional systematic or academic philosophies, in both
          style and content, as too abstract and remote from concrete human experience.</p>
        <p>Absurdism refers to the conflict between (1) the human tendency to seek inherent value and meaning in life and (2)
          the human inability to find any. In this context absurd does not mean "logically impossible", but rather "humanly
          impossible". Accordingly, absurdism is a philosophical school of thought stating that the efforts of humanity to
          find inherent meaning will ultimately fail (and hence are absurd) because the sheer amount of information as well
          as the vast realm of the unknown make total certainty impossible. As a philosophy, absurdism furthermore explores
          the fundamental nature of the Absurd and how individuals, once becoming conscious of the Absurd, should respond
          to it. Albert Camus stated that individuals should embrace the absurd condition of human existence while also defiantly
          continuing to explore and search for meaning.</p>

        <h4>1914 to 1918 - World War I, Europe</h4>
        <p>Prior to the war, Ottoman empire was driven away from Europe. There were a lot of different ethnicities/languages
          in the same country (Austro-Hungarian empire), and everyone wanted independency. What triggered the war was the
          assassination of Archduke Francis Ferdinand of Austria. The responsibles for the assassination were a Serbian group
          called Black Hands. Austria-Hungary issued an ultimatum to Serbia, designed to be unacceptable. Austria-Hungary
          declares war. Central Forces: Germany, Austria-Hungary, Ottoman Empire. Allied: Every other country. Battle of
          the Somme was one fought in Somme river, France, by the English and French against the Germans. WW1 was a trench
          warfare. Lots of machine guns, mortars, chemical weapons. There was a lot of lack of information/communication.
          After the war people lost faith in progress/mankind, as people failed to realize why there was a war in the first
          place (bad leadership by many countries!). Total deaths: 17 million deaths, 9 million Allied (France, UK, Russia,
          Italy, USA) and 8 million Central (Germany, Austria-Hungary, Ottoman Empire, Bulgaria). With the end of WW1, Allies
          and Germany signed the "Treaty of Versailles" which forced Germany to disarm, surrender territory (German colonies
          released), and pay reparations to certain countries that had formed the Entente powers (then $31.4 billion, roughly
          equivalent to US $442 billion in 2016). That amount of money was too harsh for Germany and put on them an almost
          impossible burden to get rid of. Also, they had a limit to army and navy numbers, and no air force. WW1 was characterized
          by high levels of propaganda, trench warfare, Zeppelin bombardements, huge improvements on communications, submarines</p>

        <p>Vladimir Lenin was an orthodox marxist, but he considered that humans need freedom (not like Marx). Preceded by the
          violence of WW1.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>1917: Lenin implemented marxism in USSR by 1917, after overthrowing the Tsar. He killed every "wolf"/"shepherd"
            of the society. No private property, collectivization. No motivation to produce and everyone that knew how to
            run business was killed. Economy collapsed. People were starving;</li>
          <li>1921: In 1921 Lenin (Socialist's Dilemma) allowed ownership/private property and some exchange as he saw that their
            politics were not working. Lenin died in 1924, Joseph Stalin had already taken power. Stalin was able to use
            "backstab rumors" to put every single person of Lenin's group (Trotsky, Zinoviev, Kamenev, Bukharin) against
            each other, and so he was able to take power.</li>
          <li>1927: By 1927, peasants didn't want to sell their crops for paper money ("give us gold instead, something we can
            use!") and Stalin sent 30k armed party workers to steal the crops from the peasants. In 1928 peasants planted
            less, and harvest was even worse. Russia was desperate for cash, so they sold art treasures. In 1929 Stalin created
            collective farms ("grain factories"), no more small farms where every peasant can do what they want. 10M were
            slaughtered, 10M transported to Siberia, 10M in concentration camps;</li>
          <li>1931: From 1931 to 1933 Stalin demanded large quantities of grain from the Ukrainian farmers. This caused the death
            of 5M ~ 40M by starvation in Ukraine. Hitler's methods inspired Stalin, and he began negotiations with Hitler
            in 1935. By 1935 he had 5k opponents murdered, including Zinoviev and Kamenev. Every person that appeared in
            photographs with Stalin would magically disappear, as if they were never there;</li>
          <li>1937: In 1937 Stalin wanted to be the only one that knew how the revolution was made and what it was about, so
            he killed everyone that knew the history of the revolution (3k senior police officers, 90% prosecutors, 30k army
            officers, 80% of colonels and generals, 1M party members, around 10% of the population was killed);</li>
          <li>1941: When Germany invaded in 1941, USSR was poorly prepared because of all the (military) killings that occurred
            in the years before.</li>

          deflation is very hard to take: your house is worth less, your salary decreases (as well as the price of goods
          but still, who wants to earn less?). Herbert Hoover (President of the USA by that time) made a series of serious
          mistakes. Taxes were raised, salaries were not lowered. High taxes on imported goods, which end up being disastrous
          for economy, known as Tariff Act of 1930 or Smoot-Hawley Tariff. Franklin D. Roosevelt (president from 1933 - 1945)
          increased the price of food (by taking land out of production, plowing under crops, etc). In 1933, USA had the

        <h4>1933 - Adolf Hitler Rise to Power, Germany</h4>
        <p>Treaty of Versailles placed a crushing financial burden on Germany, and sense of injustice towards Britain and France.
          Only way out (to pay the debt!): print money (hyperinflation!!!). By January 1923 a loaf of bread costed 700 marks,
          and by November of the same year 100 000 000 000 marks!!! People were paid 2 times a day (and what you were paid
          in the morning was worthless in the afternoon, hyperinflation)!!! Hyperinflation was ended overnight as Germany
          issued a new currency, attached to the price of gold. Nazi party: unification of Germany (no immigration), abrogation
          of Treaty of Versailles, territory/colonies, everyone obliged to work, confiscation of war profits (WW1), nationalization
          and profit sharing of all heavy industries. This is all very much like communism. This was a minor party, no chance
          of being elected, so they tried to sieze power by force, Munich Beer Hall Putsch, 8-9 November 1923 (hyperinflation
          was rocketing here, it was a good opportunity!!!). But they failed and Hitler was arrested. While in prison he
          wrote "Mein Kampf" ("My suffering"): two great evils, Judaism and Communism; crowds are irrational; a great leader
          can lead through propaganda; superior race must rule; those who don't fight do not deserve to live. Hitler used
          Jews as the common enemy, to unity Germany. Hitler believed that the Jews were the ones that profited the most
          (€) during WW1 (Jews owned the big companies). Hitler also believed that there was a kind of transnational identity
          between Jews, since religion unites them wherever they are (Karl Marx was jewish, he hated communism as well because
          of this transnational union). Hitler was released in 1924 from prison, took control of Nazi party in 1926. Germany
          was doing fine by 1929 (still below pre war levels), debts were paid during hyperinflation and there was lots of
          artist by that time. Nazi Party got 3% of the votes. In 1930, Smoot-Hawley Tariff (Great Depression, USA) caused
          unemployment in Germany of 40% in 1932! Nazis achieve by this time 1/3 of the votes, mostly coming from the universities
          (students and professors). Hitler united with the Communists (didn't they read his book?!) and Hitler became Chancellor.
          Hitler then set Reichstag (Capitol Building) on fire, 1933, and blamed Communists. In March 1933 Hitler won 44%
          of the vote and Reichstag passed Enabling Act, giving all legislative power to him. He banned Communists and all
          other parties.</p>

        <h4>1933 to 1939 - Events Leading to the Beginning of World War II, Europe</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>1933: SA, brownshirts, were run by Roehm. SA had 1M men by Fall 1933, 3.5M in reserve. Huge army, Hitler was afraid
            of them, so he killed around 5 ~ 7000 in the "Night of the Long Knives", July 1934, including Roehm so Hitler
            himself took control of the SA. SS, blackshirts, were highly trained, 52000. Gestapo was even worse than SA and
            SS. Hitler's plan: control Germany, destroy Versailles Treaty, make Germany the chief power of Europe, destroy
            Soviet Union, establish a continental empire, fight USA for world domination.</li>
          <li>1934: In July, 1934 Hitler assassinated Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss, as he wanted Austria to be part of Germany
            because of the high number of Germans. By 1935 Hitler repudiated Versailles Treaty. Also, Germany was allowed
            by the Allies to have 35% of the British naval strength (Britain had the largest naval army in the world by this
            time), and Hitler reached air force parity with Britain behind the scenes. Churchill was aware of this and tried
            to warn Britain, but the parliament didn't really bother. Europe was still traumatized, in the sense that a "simple
            assassination" of an Austrian Archduke (that nobody really cared) lead to the death and destruction of WW1. League
            of Nations was created in 1920 to maintain world peace, as well as Kellogg–Briand Pact in 1928, that promised
            not to use war to resolve "disputes or conflicts of whatever nature or of whatever origin they may be, which
            may arise among them.". In December 1934 there was a clash between Ethiopian and Italian soldiers in Walwal,
            border of Ethiopia, colony of Italy by that time (both countries belonged to the League of Nations). Britain
            issues warning to Italy, threatens sanctions (League of Nations). Italy, despite the warnings, attacked Ethiopia
            in October, 1935. Here Britain, France and the Allies really, lost Italy to Hitler. Previously Mussolini didn't
            go along with Hitler, but this changed after this point.
          </li>
          <li>1936: In March 1936 Hitler remilitarized Rhine, border of France, in violation of treaties. German Generals disapproved
            this action as they thought that France/Britain would invade and they were no match for them by that time, they
            would have to "withdraw with our tails between our legs". Hitler told them that it wouldn't happen... and he
            was right. This kind of conversation happened a lot during these years: "it won't work!" - General, "it will."
            - Hitler. Allies were this indulgent with Hitler because they knew that the Treaty of Versailles was too harsh
            for Germany (both money and territory), Germans were "just" reclaiming what was theirs. In May 1936 Hitler declared
            that Germany had no interest in Austria, and they signed a pact of no interference in internal affairs (he had
            assassinated their Chancellor in 1934). You are in deep trouble if Hitler tells that he has no interest in you.
            In July 1936 Hitler orders Austria Nazi party to step up activities. In November 1936, Hitler signed the Rome-Berlin
            Axis, and a pact with Japan.
          </li>
          <li>1938: In 1938 Hitler dismisses 18 generals and take control of the army. Germany then invades Austria, without
            actual conflict. In July 1938, Crisis in Czechoslovakia, German speaking Sudetens demand independence. Germany
            supports Sudetens and threatens Czechoslovakia with war if they don't give up the territory. Neville Chamberlain,
            UK's leader, flew to Munich to speak with Hitler and to sign the Munich Agreement, which gave away Sudeten's
            territory. The agreement was signed by Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and Italy. The country that owned
            the territory in question was not in the conference, Czechoslovakia!!! Czechoslovakia felt betrayed by the Allies.
            That same exact day, German generals were planning to arrest Hitler as they thought that they were on the verge
            of another world war and that Germany would be crushed easily (Czechoslovakia was allies with France and Britain),
            but with Chamberlain's approval the plan was aborted. Territory that was gave away to Germany included most factories/armament/military
            bases of Czechoslovakia (by that time a powerful country, like Britain/France). Hitler Publicity: "This is the
            last territorial claim I have to make in Europe.", Privately: "Our opponents are little worms.". Hitler became
            undisputed master of Germany, as everything he did until then worked out against all odds, he earned full respect
            of Germany's generals. Winston Churchill stated that this should have never happened, big mistake by the Allies
            to allow Czechoslovakia to "unite" with Germany, but again nobody listened. This was a turning point, if before
            France + Britain + Czechoslovakia > Germany, now Germany + Czechoslovakia > France + Britain.</li>
          <li>1939: In March 1939 Germany invaded Prague, (Chamberlain recognized betrayal), Hungary invaded Czechoslovakia for
            territory, and Slovakia declared independence. Germany invading Prague was indeed a sign that Germany maybe had
            a different plan than the simple "We are only getting back what it's ours by right", since Prague has nothing
            to do with Germans (different people, different language, different culture) and Allied leaders finally woke
            up. One week later Germany invaded Lithuania. Chamberlain stated that if Germany were to invade Poland, UK would
            enter the war. Italy invaded Albania in April. USSR offered mutual assistance pact with UK and France (USSR was
            very vulnerable, remember?), but neither UK nor France answered in 3 week (why lose a good ally vs Hitler?).
            USSR withdrawn the offer and Molotov replaced Litvinov as Foreign Commissar. Pact of steel between Hitler and
            Mussolini. Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact between Hitler and Stalin in August.</li>

        <h4>1936 to 1939 - Spanish Civil War, Spain</h4>
        <p>The Spanish Civil War was fought between the Republicans, who were loyal to the democratic, left-leaning Second Spanish
          Republic, and the Nationalists, a fascist group led by General Francisco Franco. Although often portrayed as a
          struggle between democracy and fascism, some historians consider it more accurately described as a struggle between
          leftist revolution and rightist counterrevolution. Ultimately, the Nationalists won, and Franco then ruled Spain
          for the next 36 years, from April 1939 until his death in November 1975. Around 500 000 deaths.

        <h4>1939 to 1945 - World War II, World</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>1939: In the 1st of September 1939, Germany invaded Poland. It's claimed that Germans tried to use blitzkrieg here
            for the first time, but only succeeded when invading Belgium, Netherlands and France. The basic concept of the
            blitzkrieg is to use overwhelming attacks at the enemy's weak points to drive deep behind their lines, disrupting
            communications and forcing them in unexpected directions. This concept was not new in WW2, but it became frighteningly
            effective with the greater mobility allowed by motorized vehicles, tanks and airplanes. This kind of tactic prevents
            the repetition of the attritional deadlock of WW1 (trench warfare). The very next day France and Britain declare
            war on Germany. In 17 of September USSR invaded eastern Poland, as it was arranged in the pact. In November USSR
            invaded Baltic states and Finland. Poles captured an Enigma machine and smuggled it to Britain, who quickly broke
            the code (Alan Turing). From that point on, Britain was able to listen to German communications, which brought
            all kinds of dilemmas. This one time, Britain intercepted a message from the Germans that claimed they were gonna
            bomb Coventry. Churchill decided to do nothing (evacuate, save art, etc) in order to protect their Intel from
            the Germans, a sacrifice for a greater good (his son was in Coventry!). Churchill claimed that this war was the
            result of "policy of easy-going placatory appeasement" of the 1930s. "You may have to fight when there is no
            hope of victory, because it is better to perish than live as a slave" - Winston Churchill. Churchill raised the
            Democracy's Dilemma: is this easy going inevitable for democracies as they are usually reluctant to fight wars,
            and rarely fight with other democracies? Do democracies allow tyrants to have all the time in the world to prepare
            before attacking a democracy, thus leading to a much worse/bloodier fight for the democracy? In October, Germans
            start the extermination of the sick and disabled. In November, USSR attacked Finland.</li>
          <li>1940: April 9, Nazis invaded Norway and Denmark (Denmark surrendered 2 days later). May 10, Nazis invaded Netherlands,
            Belgium, Luxembourg and France. May 10 1940, Winston Churchill finally became Prime Minister of Britain: "I have
            nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears, and sweat.". In May, June, Netherlands, Belgium, Norway surrendered.
            June 4, Dunkirk Battle on the north of France gets France and Britain trapped by the Nazis. Britain was able
            to evacuate 300k soldiers by sea. Nazis had the largest air force of Europe, why didn't they bomb and killed
            every trapped soldier? British are anglo-saxons, so maybe Hitler didn't want to kill them, but to join forces
            with them as he thought they were the same aryan race. In June 1940, Nazis entered Paris and France surrendered.
            In July, battle with Britain began. Nazis bombed airfields (in order to ground them!), factories, cities (London,
            August 13). August 15, Britain bombed Berlin. Hitler finally started making some mistake: "We'll bomb the airfields
            so they can't fly", "They are still flying, let's bomb their factories instead". In fact they were almost grounded
            if Nazis kept bombing their airfields!</li>
          <li>1941: June 22, Germans invaded USSR. Hitler wanted their territory and wanted to wipe out every Slav/Jew as they
            were not pure enough to live, as Britain for example. Stalin ordered Scorched Earth Policy: destroy everything
            that could be used by the Germans. Stain shoot army officers to prevent coup, soldiers had no choice but to fight
            to the death. Stalin transported entire nations. In the first of August, US embargos oil against Japan. By that
            time Japan was expanding to the south east Asia, and that worried USA. In 7th of December, Japan bombed Pearl
            Harbor (along with other countries in Asia). Franklin D. Roosevelt (US) declared war on Japan the very next day.
            December 11, Germany and Italy declare war on US (very similar to Czechoslovakia, tip the balance in favor of
            the allies). Japan knew they would go to war with the US eventually, so they simply attacked, no real plan here...
          </li>
          <li>1942: May 4-8, Battle of the Coral Sea (north east Australia). June 4-6, Battle of Midway (midway between Hawaii
            and Japan). Both battles were won by the US by sheer luck (they were lucky to stumble upon Japanese fleet on
            which was supposed to be a surprise attack), but Japan lost the Pacific in less than 6 months. Both battles were
            fought using only aircrafts, ships never really saw each other. After Midway, US started a strategy of island-hop.
            August 7-20, Battle of Guadalcanal. US war production was already greater than the Axis forces combined. March
            28, Bombing of Lubeck by the US. May 30, bombing against Cologne. June, Hitler began the mass murder of Jews
            in Auschwitz. September to February (5 months!), Battle of Stalingrad on the western front, one of the most important
            and decisive battles of the war (too costly for both sides, Russia and Germany).</li>
          <li>1943: May, Axis forces surrendered in North of Africa. July, income tax withholding begins in the US. July 10,
            Allies invade Sicily. November, Tarawa (island in the Pacific) war.</li>
          <li>1944: June 6, D-Day invasion of Normandy, North of France. This invasion was a kind of a suicide mission, in the
            sense that Germany knew that this attack was coming and were well prepared. Nevertheless, they succeeded after
            3 months. June 13, first V-1 rocket attack on Britain. August 25, Liberation of Paris. December, Battle of the
            Bulge, Eastern Front. This was really the last opportunity for the Germans to win the war.</li>
          <li>1945: January 26, Soviets liberate Auschwitz. April 12, Franklin D. Roosevelt died. April 28, Mussolini is hanged.
            April 30, Hitler commits suicide along with his wife, "Afterwards, you rue the fact that you have been so kind".
            During Hitler's final days in the bunker in Berlin, his health was very deteriorated, only drugs (Germany's army
            and leaders took a fairly amount of drugs during WW2 to stay awake for long, to be more active, etc) were keeping
            him with energy to lead a country. February 19 to March 26, Iwo Jima Battle, island near Japan. April 1 to July
            2, Okinawa Battle, halfway between Taiwan and Japan. Japanese were known for their Kamikaze moves, where one
            man plane was crashed into US forces. August 6, atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima. August 9, atomic bomb dropped
            on Nagasaki. For the first time (not only here, but during WW2) in warfare civilians became targets. Japan was
            the only territory left to conquer in the Pacific, and Japanese were gonna fight till the end. US estimated that
            they would lose 2M american lives if they were to invade Japan. Dropping atomic bombs was more effective... August
            14, Japan surrendered. The war ended with two atomic bombs. Overall, more than 60M died during WW2, ~ 50M for
            Allies (26M Soviet Union, 6M Poland, 600k France, 400k UK, 400k USA) and ~12 M for Axis (7M Germany, 3M Japan,
            400k Italy).</li>

        <h4>1950 to 1953 - Korean War Korea</h4>
        <p>The Korean War began when North Korea invaded South Korea. The United Nations, with the US and UK as the main forces,
          came to the aid of South Korea. China, with assistance from the Soviet Union, came to the aid of North Korea. The
          war arose from the division of Korea at the end of WW2 and from the global tensions of the Cold War that developed
          immediately afterwards. The fighting ended on 27 July 1953, when an armistice was signed. The agreement created
          the Korean Demilitarized Zone to separate North and South Korea, and allowed the return of prisoners. However,
          no peace treaty has been signed, and the two Koreas are technically still at war. ~2.5M deaths.

        <h4>1955 to 1975 - Vietnam War, Vietnam</h4>
        <p>The Vietnam War and known in Vietnam as Resistance War Against America or simply the American War, was a Cold War-era
          proxy war that occurred in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia from 1 November 1955 to the fall of Saigon on 30 April 1975.
          This war followed the First Indochina War (1946–54) and was fought between North Vietnam — supported by the Soviet
          Union, China and other communist allies — and the government of South Vietnam — supported by the United States,
          Philippines and other anti-communist allies. USA claimed that if Vietnam felt under the communism Soviet Union,
          other countries in Asia would fall as well (domino theory). Vietnam War begins just as social revolutions get underway:
          JFK’s Camelot, sexual liberation, civil rights, women’s rights, rock 'n' roll, drugs, middle class emancipation.
          U.S. involvement escalated in the early 1960s, with troop levels tripling in 1961 and again in 1962. U.S. involvement
          escalated further following the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin incident, in which a U.S. destroyer clashed with North Vietnamese
          fast attack craft, which was followed by the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, which gave the U.S. president authorization
          to increase U.S. military presence. US lost the propaganda battle, as well as faith in the battle. Gradual withdrawal
          of U.S. ground forces began as part of "Vietnamization" (Richard Nixon administration), which aimed to end American
          involvement in the war while transferring the task of fighting the Communists to the South Vietnamese themselves.
          Despite the Paris Peace Accord, which was signed by all parties in January 1973, the fighting continued. In the
          U.S. and the Western world, a large anti-Vietnam War movement developed as part of a larger counterculture. Direct
          U.S. military involvement ended on 15 August 1973. The capture of Saigon by the North Vietnamese Army in April
          1975 marked the end of the war, and North and South Vietnam were reunified the following year. Around ~2M total
          deaths, 700k South Vietnam, 800k North Vietnam, 50k from the US.

        <h4>1959 - Suez Crisis, Egypt</h4>
        <p>The Suez Crisis was an invasion of Egypt in late 1956 by Israel, followed by the United Kingdom and France. The aims
          were to regain Western control of the Suez Canal and to remove Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser from power.
          After the fighting had started, the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Nations forced the three invaders
          to withdraw. The episode humiliated Great Britain and France and strengthened Nasser. On October 29, Israel invaded
          the Egyptian Sinai. Britain and France issued a joint ultimatum to cease fire, which was ignored. On November 5,
          Britain and France landed paratroopers along the Suez Canal. The Egyptian forces were defeated, but they did block
          the canal to all shipping. It became clear that the Israeli invasion and the subsequent Anglo-French attack had
          been planned beforehand by the three countries. The three allies had attained a number of their military objectives,
          but the Canal was now useless and heavy pressure from the United States and the USSR forced them to withdraw. U.S.
          President Dwight D. Eisenhower had strongly warned Britain not to invade; he now threatened serious damage to the
          British financial system. Historians conclude the crisis "signified the end of Great Britain's role as one of the
          world's major powers". The Suez Canal was closed from October 1956 until March 1957. Israel fulfilled some of its
          objectives, such as attaining freedom of navigation through the Straits of Tiran.

        <h4>1959 to 1961 - Great Chinese Famine, China</h4>
        <p>Drought, poor weather, and the policies of the Communist Party of China contributed to the famine that killed at
          least 45M people, although the relative weights of the contributions are disputed due to the Great Leap Forward
          (economic and social campaign by the Communist Party of China). The campaign was led by Mao Zedong and aimed to
          rapidly transform the country from an agrarian (crops and farmland) economy into a socialist society through rapid
          industrialization and collectivization.

        <h4>1960s - The Sixties and Great Society, US and Europe</h4>
        <p>The second world war was totally disruptive for the society, as it changed all kinds of patterns that existed previously.
          It provided the basis for the revolution that happened during the sixties. Dwight D. Eisenhower (General during
          WW2, Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Europe) was a great president during the 50s, responsible for the
          recovery of the US. In the 50s there was a low level of inequality. Themes of the 60s: abortion, homosexuals, racism.
          Democratic welfare, well being of every member in the society. John Rawls: free, rational, self-interested, equal.
          Martin Luther King: "I have a dream...".
        </p>
        <p>Abortion has been legal on a wide number of grounds in England and Wales and Scotland since the Abortion Act 1967,
          then one of the most liberal abortion laws in Europe. The 60s were a time of liberalism, young vs old, established
          vs not established, young wanted fashion, pleasure and image, that was their holy trinity. Art was hollow, easy
          to create as everything that was considered different was art. Andy Warhol in public criticized classical art,
          although his personal collection consisted on that. Britain got rid of 66% of the railways (they were old fashioned,
          Victorian), so lots of roads were built, which caused car based traffic and so lots of jams. Decade where there
          was a triumph of hedonism, instant pleasure vs long term goals.

          during 1972, following the break-in at the Watergate Hotel. By 1973, Nixon had been re-elected, but the storm clouds
          were building. By early 1974, the nation was consumed by Watergate. In August 1974, Nixon resigned.

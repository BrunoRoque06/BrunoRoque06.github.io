# About

My name is Bruno Roque, and I'm a Portuguese Software Engineer. I am happily married since June 2017, after dating my now wife for 11 years. And we have the cutest dog in the world! I love everything related to chess, and I also enjoy movies, and books.

In this website it's possible to find information about myself, and about side projects in which I work. For now, most information is code related.

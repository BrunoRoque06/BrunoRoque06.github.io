                        My name is Bruno Roque, and I'm a Portuguese Software Engineer. I am happily married since June 2017, after dating for 11 years, and we have the cutest dog in the world! I love everything related to chess.

                        In this website it's possible to find information about myself, and about side projects in which I work. For now, most information is code related.

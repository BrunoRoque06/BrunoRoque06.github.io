        <h2>Software Architecture</h2>
        <p>This page contains information on systems designs, and problem solving. Its main focus is Software Architecture, but most concepts are applicable to any area where design is involved.</p>
        <p>"Organizations which design systems... are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures
          of these organizations." - Melvin Conway</p>

        <h3>Design</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Four essential steps to iterate over:
            <ol>
              <li>Which are the problems? Use cases, business requirements, company goals.</li>
              <li>How to solve them? Define "-ilities" (like speed, scalability, deployability, etc).</li>
              <li>Why?</li>
              <li>How to validate?</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>Architecture components that can change, that are volatile, should be identified by looking at the clients and
            at the future.
          </li>
          <li>Conceptual Integrity: All of the parts of a system relate to each other and relate to the whole. There is nothing
            unnecessary, and all of the parts have an internal consistency. The design must proceed from one mind, or from
            a very small number of agreeing resonant minds.</li>
          <li>"After teaching a software engineering laboratory more than 20 times, I came to insist that student teams as small
            as four people choose a manager and a separate architect. Defining distinct roles in such small teams may be
            a little extreme, but I have observed it to work well and to contribute to design success even for small teams."

          <li>Mono-repositories provide advantages like TODO</li>
          <li>Development processes should be taken into account when making the design decisions, since they will impact TODO</li>

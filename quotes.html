        <h2>Quotes</h2>
        <p>Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take. - Antonie de
          Exupery</p>
        <p>The limits of my language mean the limits of my world. - Ludwig Wittgenstein</p>
        <p>There is a luxury in self-reproach. When we blame ourselves, we feel that no one else has a right to blame us. It
          is the confession, not the priest, that gives us absolution. - Oscar Wilde</p>
        <p>Those who cannot change their minds cannot change anything. - George Bernard Shaw</p>
        <p>I'd woken up early, and I took a long time getting ready to exist. - Fernando Pessoa</p>
        <p>In fondo, è solo un trucco. Sì, è solo un trucco. - La Grande Bellezza</p>
        <p>"So that's what it is!" he suddenly exclaimed aloud. "What joy!" - Leo Tolstoy</p>

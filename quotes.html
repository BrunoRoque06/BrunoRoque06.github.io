        <h2>Quotes</h2>
        <p>Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take. ― Antoine de
          Saint-Exupéry, Airman's Odyssey
        </p>
        <p>The limits of my language mean the limits of my world. ― Ludwig Wittgenstein</p>
        <p>There is a luxury in self―reproach. When we blame ourselves, we feel that no one else has a right to blame us. It
          is the confession, not the priest, that gives us absolution. ― Oscar Wilde, The Picture of Dorian Gray</p>
        <p>Those who cannot change their minds cannot change anything. ― George Bernard Shaw</p>
        <p>Progress, far from consisting in change, depends on retentiveness. When change is absolute there remains no being
          to improve and no direction is set for possible improvement: and when experience is not retained, as among savages,
          infancy is perpetual. Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. ― George Santana, Life of
          Reason
        </p>
        <p>Good fences make good neighbors. ― Robert Frost, Mending Wall</p>
        <p>Pain and suffering are always inevitable for a large intelligence and a deep heart. The really great men must, I think, have great sadness on earth. ― Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Crime and Punishment</p>
        <p>I'd woken up early, and I took a long time getting ready to exist. ― Fernando Pessoa, The Book of Disquiet</p>
        <p>In fondo, è solo un trucco. Sì, è solo un trucco. ― Jep Gambardella, La Grande Bellezza</p>
        <p>"So that's what it is!" he suddenly exclaimed aloud. "What joy!" ― Leo Tolstoy, The Death of Ivan Ilych</p>
